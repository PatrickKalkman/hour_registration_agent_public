## Introduction

As a freelancer, the accuracy of my invoicing is crucial. Achieving this requires accurately recording my work hours. I aim to log these hours daily, capturing my activities while they are still fresh in my mind.
Yet, despite my best intentions, the daily whirlwind of tasks often leads to oversights. This can result in the need to painstakingly reconstruct my day, a process that is not only time-consuming but also frustrating.
Fascinated by artificial intelligence's potential to simplify complex tasks, I created an AI-driven solution for automating hour registration. This article describes my endeavor to streamline my daily routine and ensure no critical detail slips through the cracks.
The aim is to free up valuable time and mental energy, allowing me to focus on what truly matters: work.
